    <h1>Newtons Laws of Motion</h1>
    <div class="border">
        <h2>First Law</h2>
        <p class="def">An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains 
            in motion at constant <span>speed</span> and in a straight line unless 
            acted on by an unbalanced force.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Second Law</h2>
    <p id="second">The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and 
        the amount of force applied.</p>
    <h2>Third Law</h2>
    <p>Whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second 
        object exerts an equal and opposite on the first.</p>
